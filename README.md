                                      ATM System using biometric authentication
ABSTRACT

In today's world security is a matter of concern to each and every user in this fast growing technology era so to be secure we should always be
updated with the technology. As, the project name suggests advance security system is related to the security system of accessig ATM machine in a totally different way . Nowadays there are many cases of ATM frauds and like cloning of ATM card , stealing of the card and asking for the pin by threatening with arms ,and many more . So, to avoid these type of problems associated with usage of ATM we can use biometrics of a user to authenticate along with one time password(otp) for accessing the atm .It will also help to avoid remembering of several security pin associated with the different bank of single customer. Sometime there are also issues of damaged or lost cards. So people have to wait for long for the generation of new card . This system will save time and money.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

In today's world security is a matter of concern to each and every user in this fast growing technology era so to be secure we should always be updated with the technology.As, the project name suggests advance security system is related to the security system of accessing ATM machine in a totally different way . Nowadays there are many cases of ATM frauds and like cloning of ATM card , stealing of the card and asking for the pin by threatening with arms ,and many more . So, to avoid these type of problems associated with usage of ATM we can use biometrics of a user to authenticate along with one time password(otp) for accessing the atm .It will also help to avoid remembering of several security pin associated with the different bank of single customer. Sometime there are also issues of damaged or lost cards. So people have to wait for long for the generation of new card. This system will save time and money.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

First of all there will be a user interface of ATM system which has been developed in Python tkinter user interface There will be a mysql database which store the database of customer there account no name phone no address age Balance and most important biometrics data of customer After the verification of fingerprint or face authentication otp will be sent to the customer registered mobile no The customer has to enter the the otp to the screen for matching with the database After matching the database the user will be directed to their for their transaction

EXISTING SYSTEM

When the user select the bank it will redirected to authentication page where user has to authenticate their biometric after succesfull authentication otp will be send to the registered mobile no and after entering the otp the user will easily authenticate to the system can perform the transaction

PROPOSED SYSTEM

In further there will be no extension in the project as it is already extended to add fingerprint and face authentication in the system

APPENDICES

Details of software/simulator if any Software Requirement(any one )

Message app installed in the Device
Fingerprint reader in the Device


Steps to execute/run/implement the project 
1.)Connect the application with the atm machine 
2.2.)Connect to the bank Database for Customer Details 
3.3.)Scan the fingerprint for the authentication 
4.4.)Enter the Otp sent to the Registered no 
5.5.)Complete the transaction
